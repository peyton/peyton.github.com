Dabblers create, then abandon, open source imitations.

I've picked real examples, but not to single any out---I have tremendous respect for those who ship.

## Facebook's pullaway menus ##

Last fall Facebook [redesigned](http://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2482541/facebook-4-0-for-iphone-review) its iPhone app, revamping its navigation to a never-before-seen slide-under list.

When you copy Facebook, you inherit its constraints. A full-featured app for an eight-year-old social network of 800 million has *a lot* to do---see the [7,968-word Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features). A do-one-thing-well photo app? Not so much.

So what do you do when you're in love with the pullaway menu? You invent chew toys to toss at your users. News becomes Popular, Nearby, and Latest. Photos becomes My Photos, Friends' Photos, and Trending Photos. Throw in a Sign Out and maybe an About Us. After all, there's plenty of room, and plenty more after that!

**Focus.**

### Case study: Path ###

For those unfamiliar, [Path](https://path.com/) is an iOS "smart journal," a simple, share-everything Facebook for close friends. Not long after Facebook's redesign, Path introduced [Path 2](http://blog.path.com/post/13533662902/introducing-path-2-the-smart-journal), which cribbed Facebook's pullaway menu.

Here's what's behind each of Path's menu options:

* **Home** is actually the news feed. It displays photos, check-ins, comments, etc. from you and your friends. In the lower left is the lauded plus button for adding content. Also, the whole feed's prefaced by a gorgeous cover photo. Very well done.

* **Path** confuses me. It's identical to the news feed above, except the cover photo is bigger. My name is at the top, but I can't change it from here. Also, this news page shows only my posts yet has no way to create new ones. Path could be Path's term for a profile, but who knows? Since it's also the name of the service, I only go here when I really mean to tap Home.

* **Activity** mirrors the news feed in a condensed form. Photos are thumbnails, and you can't comment directly on news items. I don't see any other differences.
* **Settings** holds profile information, notification settings, and stuff that should belong in Settings.app. Profile settings makes more sense accessed from the profile page, and notification settings make more sense accessed from a notification pane.

* **Sign Out.** "Hey, I'm gonna take a nap. I want to leave a testament to this on Path, but my phone-I-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet isn't with me. Can I borrow your phone-you-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet to log into my account?" "Sure. Good thing there's a huge Sign Out button *right here*."

If Facebook's design had never happened, what would the consequences have been? Path might've picked a less confusing interaction flow, perhaps merging Home and Path and placing settings in contextually relevant locations. It turns out their app doesn't need explicit navigation. It's a bad sign when a tool creates the problem it solves.

**Think.** Pick one or two ideas and make them big. Reason through your app's interactions and the need for a pullaway menu disappears.

### Stealing the pullaway: Gmail ###

*not done* Gmail uses its pullaway for one task, not many, blah blah blah.

At the top lies the current email. *Useful*. I always know my name, but I don't always know which of my five emails I'm managing.

There's a lot not to like about Gmail: the crashes, the feeble performance, the non-native scrolling, and so on. But its pullaway menu really nails inbox browsing.

## The web's native pantomime ##

Yeah, my iPhone 4 could command five Space Shuttles and send a reality TV-sized family to the moon, but it's *damn slow*. Like 1995's Pentium Pro slow.
