## Facebook pullaway menus ##

When you copy Facebook, you inherit its constraints. A full-featured app for an eight-year-old social network of 800 million has *a lot* to do--see the [7,968-word Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features). A do-one-thing well photo app? Not so much.

So what do you do when you're in love with the pullaway menu? You invent chew toys to toss at your users. News becomes Popular, Nearby, and Latest. Photos becomes My Photos, Friends' Photos, and Trending Photos. Throw in a Sign Out and maybe an About Us. After all, there's plenty of room, and plenty more after that!

**Focus.**

### Case study: Path ###

For those unfamiliar, [Path](https://path.com/) is an iOS "smart journal," a simple, share-everything Facebook for close friends.

Here's what Path's pullaway menu items do:

* **Home**

* **Path**

* **Activity**

* **Settings**

* **Sign Out**

With thought its menu button disappears.
