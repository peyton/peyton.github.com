## Facebook pullaway menus ##

When you copy Facebook, you inherit its constraints. A full-featured app for an eight-year-old social network of 800 million has *a lot* to do--see the [7,968-word Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features). A do-one-thing well photo app? Not so much.

So what do you do when you're in love with the pullaway menu? You invent chew toys to toss at your users. News becomes Popular, Nearby, and Latest. Photos becomes My Photos, Friends' Photos, and Trending Photos. Throw in a Sign Out and maybe an About Us. After all, there's plenty of room, and plenty more after that!

**Focus.**

### Case study: Path ###

For those unfamiliar, [Path](https://path.com/) is an iOS "smart journal," a simple, share-everything Facebook for close friends.

Here's what's behind each of Path's menu options:

* **Home** is actually the news feed. It displays photos, check-ins, comments, etc. from you and your friends. The lauded Path plus button for adding new content. And it's all prefaced by a gorgeous configurable cover photo. Very well done.

* **Path** is confusing. It's identical to the news feed above, except the cover photo is bigger. My name is at the top, but I can't change it from here. Also, this news page shows only my posts but has no way to create new items. It may be Path's name for a profile, but who knows? Since it's also the name of the service, I only go here when I really mean to tap Home.

* **Activity** mirrors the news feed in a condensed form. Photos are thumbnails, and you can't comment directly on news items. I don't see any other differences.

* **Settings** holds profile information, notification settings, and stuff that should belong in Settings.app. Profile settings makes more sense accessed from the profile page, and notification settings make more sense accessed from a notification pane.

* **Sign Out.** "Hey, I'm gonna take a nap. I want to post this on Path, but my phone-I-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet isn't with me. Can I borrow your phone-you-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet and log into my account?"
"Sure. Good thing there's a huge sign out button *right here*. Have fun figuring out which email and password to use!"

With thought the menu button disappears.
