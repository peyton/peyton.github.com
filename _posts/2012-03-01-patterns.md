I love firing up an iOS app for the first time and seeing new interaction ideas. As a developer, I get the whole "This is cool!" and "Why didn't I think of this?" and "This could totally shake up my next app." Pretty soon emotion turns into action and I'm crouching over Xcode or Photoshop.

I'm not alone. A flurry of creation develops over every high-profile app launch. Sword-sharpening designers make piles of mockups. Dabblers publish, then abandon, open source imitations. HTML apps riff on native patterns. [Entire](http://pttrns.com/) [sites](http://mobile-patterns.com/) cache the thoughts of mobile maestros. Great ideas first used to solve a hyper-specific problem become "the way things are done."

People copy new ideas. *blah blah blah*

I've picked real examples, sure, but not to single anyone out---I have tremendous respect for those who ship.

## Facebook's pullaway menus ##

Last fall Facebook [redesigned](http://www.theverge.com/2011/10/14/2482541/facebook-4-0-for-iphone-review) its iPhone app, revamping its navigation to a never-before-seen slide-under list. Within *seconds*, [scores](http://dribbble.com/shots/438343-Mused-App-Menu) [of](http://dribbble.com/shots/328680-Menu-Page) [clones](http://dribbble.com/shots/363643-TouristEye-App-Menu) [popped](http://dribbble.com/shots/379777-Icon-menu-iPhone-Retina-Display) [up](http://dribbble.com/shots/406034-Menu) [on](http://dribbble.com/shots/303814-mobile-pullout-menu-for-responsive-design) [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/shots/352066-Float-Reader-Menu-Sneak-Peek) and [on](https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck) [GitHub](https://github.com/devindoty/DDMenuController) ([and](https://github.com/mystcolor/JTRevealSidebarDemo) [so](https://github.com/meiwin/MWFSlideNavigationViewController) [on](https://github.com/pkluz/ZUUIRevealController) [and](https://github.com/jeremieweldin/JWSlideMenu) [so](https://github.com/inonb/SlideMenuController) [forth](https://github.com/edgecase/ECSlidingViewController)[&hellip;](https://github.com/mpociot/titanium-facebook-slide-menu))

When you copy Facebook, you inherit its constraints. A full-featured app for an eight-year-old social network of 800 million has *a lot* to do---see the [7,968-word Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features). A do-one-thing-well photo app? Not so much.

So what do you do when you're in love with the pullaway menu? You invent chew toys to toss at your users. News becomes Popular, Nearby, and Latest. Photos becomes My Photos, Friends' Photos, and Trending Photos. Throw in a Sign Out and maybe an About Us. After all, there's plenty of room, and plenty more after that!

**Focus.**

### Case study: Path ###

For those unfamiliar, [Path](https://path.com/) is an iOS "smart journal," a simple, share-everything Facebook for close friends. Not long after Facebook's redesign, Path introduced [Path 2](http://blog.path.com/post/13533662902/introducing-path-2-the-smart-journal), which cribbed Facebook's pullaway menu.

</figure>

Here's what's behind each of Path's menu options:

* **Home** is actually the news feed. It displays photos, check-ins, comments, etc. from you and your friends. In the lower left is the lauded plus button for adding content. Also, the whole feed's prefaced by a gorgeous cover photo. Very well done.

* **Path** confuses me. It could be Path's term for a profile, but who knows? It's identical to the news feed above, except the cover photo is bigger. My name is at the top, but I can't change it from here. Also, this news page shows only my posts yet has no way to create new ones. Since it's also the name of the service, I only go here when I really mean to tap Home.

* **Activity** mirrors the news feed in a condensed form. Photos are thumbnails, and you can't comment directly on news items. I don't see any other differences.

* **Settings** holds profile information, notification settings, and stuff that belongs in Settings.app. Profile settings makes more sense accessed from the profile page, and notification settings make more sense accessed from a notification pane.

* **Sign Out.** "Hey, I'm gonna take a nap. I want to leave a testament to this on Path, but my phone-I-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet isn't with me. Can I borrow your phone-you-take-everywhere-even-to-the-toilet to log into my account?"

If Facebook's pullaway had never happened, what would the consequences have been? Path might've picked a less confusing interaction flow, perhaps merging Home and Path and placing settings in contextually relevant locations. No explicit navigation needed. It's a bad sign when a tool creates the problem it solves.

**Think.** Pick one or two ideas and make them big. Reason through your app's navigation and the need for a pullaway menu disappears.

### Stealing the pullaway: Gmail ###

<figure markdown="1">
    ![Gmail pullaway]({{ site.cdn }}{{ page.url }}Gmail-Pullaway.png)
</figure>

Gmail steals the pullaway by using it for **one task**, not many. When you think about it, its use is way different from Facebook-style directory navigation. Gmail turns pullaway tropes into real features.

At the top lies the current email. *Useful*. I always know my name, but I don't always know which of my five emails I'm managing.

The bulk of the pullaway exists to help me find my mail. Swipe to see the same folders I've used for years. Touch a folder and I'm back to mail. Simple and easy to understand.

There's a lot keeping me from using Gmail: the crashes, the feeble performance, the non-native scrolling, and so on. But its pullaway menu really nails inbox browsing.

**Steal the pullaway** by using it as a razor-sharp, super-specialized tool, not as a license to stop thinking critically about navigation.

## Sign Up! Log In! ##

Ever stared at one of these?

*blah blah blah*

## More cached thoughts to&nbsp;recompute ##

* **Flipboard's flipping.** Please steal this. Nobody else seems to. Flipboard is one of the best iOS apps because it's so natural, and it's so natural because it's so responsive. There's no scroll jerking. Flipping hides latency by rate limiting the user to a few articles at a time. Think about creatively hiding UI lag rather than throwing everything in a table view.

* **Clear's gestures.** Even if you haven't yet seen [Clear](http://www.youtube.com/embed/0nBLtPC7mnI), you'll soon be swiping and pinching through feelalikes once they hit the App Store. There are two open source clones: [Opaque](https://github.com/MassiveHealth/Opaque) and [JTGestureBasedTableViewDemo](https://github.com/mystcolor/jtgesturebasedtableviewdemo). Be careful about stealing these. What feels natural on a todo list---crossing off and flicking through---won't work on your network-heavy, resource-intensive mobile social local weather app for wine enthusiasts.

* **Native pantomimes on the web.** This doesn't belong in this list, as I doubt anybody thinks it's a good idea. [OnSwipe](http://onswipe.com/) doesn't cut it. [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch) doesn't either. Yeah, my iPhone 4 could command five Space Shuttles and send a reality TV-sized family to the moon, but it's *damn slow*. Like 1995's Pentium Pro slow. Feed my browser real webpages.
