## Facebook pullaway menus ##

When you copy Facebook, you inherit their constraints. There's a [7,968-word Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_features) listing *most* of Facebook's features. A full-featured app for an eight-year-old social network of 800 million has *a lot* to do. A do-one-thing well photo app? Not so much.

So what do you do when you're in love with the pullaway menu? You invent new chew toys to toss at your users. "News" becomes "Popular," "Nearby," and "Latest." "Photos" becomes "My photos," "Friends' photos", and "Trending photos." Throw in a "Sign out" and maybe an "About us." After all, there's plenty of room, and plenty more to go!

Focus.

### Case study: Path ###

For those unfamiliar, [Path](https://path.com/) is an iOS "smart journal." It's a simple, share-everything Facebook for close friends.
